# resume
Location of resume friendly code

Since there is nothing here currently, I will leave a link to two podcasts I think are relevant:
- http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/tag/linux-action-show/
- http://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/

In-Progress: 
- Added to Asana tasking to upload friendly code that can be viewed for resume work
- Start a blog with some of the abstracted code snippets so information is publically viewable with human subtex
